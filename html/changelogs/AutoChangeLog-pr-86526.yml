changes:
  - balance: "AIs piloting mechs no longer die if they hit the supermatter, nor do they harmlessly snap back to their core. The shock now causes them to produce a massive EMP."
  - balance: "Undid a balance change I did during the malf AI refactor. The doomsday countdown will no longer stop if a malf AI dominates a mech."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a few bugs with AI shunting and AI mech death."
