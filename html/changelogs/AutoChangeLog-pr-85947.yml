changes:
  - bugfix: "Having the Overflow Role set to On will properly ensure you get that role at a High priority as intended by the game code."
  - bugfix: "Job selection is now a little bit more random. Fixes an unintentional bias in random job assignment that could lead to feast-or-famine for roles where everyone is assigned one job and nobody is assigned another job."
