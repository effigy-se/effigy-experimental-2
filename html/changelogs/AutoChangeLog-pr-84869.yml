changes:
  - rscadd: "You can now craft tether anchors, which can be secured with a wrench and attached to with right click. They won't let you drift into space and you can adjust tether length/cut it via lmb/rmb/ctrl click on the wire."
  - rscadd: "MOD tethers now remotely place and connect to tether anchors instead of throwing you at where they landed."
  - balance: "MOD tethers can now be used in gravity"
  - balance: "Jetpacks are now inertia-based."
  - balance: "Guns can accelerate you significantly in zero-g."
  - balance: "All jetpacks now give you equal speed buff, however advanced MOD ion jets and captain's jetpack have higher acceleration/deceleration values."
  - refactor: "Refactored zero-g movement to be inertia-based and utilize angles instead of directions."
